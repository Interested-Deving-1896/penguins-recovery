# Shared Tool Lists

Common package/tool definitions used across recovery builders. Each builder
maps these logical tool names to its own package manager's naming conventions.

## Files

- `core-tools.list` -- Minimal set of tools present in every recovery image
- `disk-tools.list` -- Disk management, partitioning, and filesystem tools
- `network-tools.list` -- Network diagnostics and connectivity
- `firmware.list` -- CPU microcode and firmware packages
